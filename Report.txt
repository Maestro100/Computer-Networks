Unregister- Just remove the socket form the hash map
Ctrl-C- We can throw an exception in the server sender thread(which forwards the message), and handle it by removing the entry from the hash map.

Instead of removing the entry from the hash map, we make a queue and store these messages and send a single tick response to the sender,
when the user registers again, then we will 1st check if there is a residual queue of messages and keep sending blue ticks to the old sender.
